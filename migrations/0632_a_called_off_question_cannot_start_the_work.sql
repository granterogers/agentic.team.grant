/*
  0632 - a question left open by work that was called off cannot start that work (Final audit reconciliation; found
  by the independent review, original audit invariants 5 and 25).

  `stop_conversation_work`, `cancel_group` and `request_stop` cancel jobs and never touch the questions those jobs had
  open. `hq_answer_blocker` and `answer_generation_approval` never looked at the asking job's state, so a later Yes (a
  stale Approve button on Slack or Telegram, a dashboard press) answered the question and queued the withdrawn
  `notebook.generate` child, or the `on_answer` work - an external NotebookLM write he had called off.

  Now, for an asking job that is cancelled: the answer is still RECORDED (it is what he said, and the question is
  closed) and nothing is STARTED; the reply says it was called off. A live job behaves exactly as before.

    #130 is about, one layer up.

    Scoped to the blocker's own project. A question asked about one project is
    not consent for every project, and `grant_standing` takes null for
    everywhere only when a caller passes it deliberately.

    Never fatal, and never silent: if the grant is refused (a level-3 tool, an
    unknown one) the answer still resolves the blocker and the outcome says
    what happened, because losing Grant's answer to protect a permission would
    be the worse of the two.

    answers, those files are no longer in the change list and there is nothing
    left to act on. A dead option on a question he can see.

    raised it: a job kind and one payload per thing. Not a model's words and
    not an interpretation of the option text -- the parsing defect #130 is
    about, on a path that enqueues work.

    Bounded on purpose: through `app.enqueue_child`, on the blocker's own job,
    so the child inherits the project and the requester and
    `enforce_delegation_depth` caps it. Nothing here can reach a project the
    question did not come from.
