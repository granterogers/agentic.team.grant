-- Issue #68, and the caller 0228 was missing. That migration built
-- `app.studio_requests()` and nothing called it, which is the fourth time today
-- this session has built a mechanism and forgotten the mouth — the noticing
-- pass nobody read, the tool request that reached nobody, `connector_purpose`
-- with no caller, and now this. Written as its own migration so the pattern is
-- visible in the log rather than hidden inside another change.
