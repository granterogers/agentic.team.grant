/**
 * The project a surface named is the project the work goes to.
 *
 * Issue #192, finishing what 0335 and 0336 started.
 *
 * 0335 added inbound_commands.project_id. 0336 made enqueue_inbound write the
 * job's resolved project back to it, so a message and its answer could not
 * split across two conversations. Both correct, and between them they left the
 * column WRITE-ONLY: nothing ever read it, so a caller that named a project
 * had that thrown away in favour of "the most recently updated active project".
 *
 * verify:conversation caught it by printing where the job actually landed - the
 * command said one project, the job reported another, and the check passed
 * because it had been written to follow the job. The number was right and the
 * routing was wrong.
 *
 * A column nothing reads is 0298's web.search with the sign flipped: a claim in
 * the schema that no code honours. The studio sending from a project page
 * (#193, #26) would have been silently misfiled from the day it shipped.
 *
 * ## Order of preference, most specific first
 *
 *   1. context->>'project_id'  - a button pressed on a named asset (#27)
 *   2. inbound_commands.project_id - the surface said which project it is in
 *   3. most recently updated active project - a guess, and still the path for
 *      193 of 194 messages ever sent
 *
 * Step 2 compares against unnamed_project() rather than null, because the
 * column is NOT NULL and defaults to Unnamed. That default exists so a message
 * can never be lost to an unresolvable project - it is not a routing
 * instruction, and treating it as one would send substantially all of Grant's
 * Telegram traffic to the reserved project.

    0335 gave inbound_commands a project_id and 0336 made this function write

    perfectly well which project it is sending from had that knowledge thrown

    the web.search trap in a new place: it claims something that is not true.

    pressed on a document names that document's project). Above the fallback,
    which is a guess.

    Compared against unnamed_project() rather than null, because the column is
    NOT NULL and defaults to Unnamed - so "unset" reads as Unnamed here, and an
    adapter that could not resolve a project still reaches the heuristic rather
    than sending everything to the reserved project. That default is what keeps

    Added because #192 gave inbound_commands a project of its own and this
    function chooses the job's project independently - so the two could
    disagree and split one exchange across two conversations: Grant's message
    under the column's default, the office's answer under the job's project.

    Measured before changing anything: 193 of 194 enqueued commands reach the
    "most recently updated active project" fallback above, and exactly one has
    ever named a project in its context. So the heuristic is not an edge case,
    it is the path - which is why this reconciles the command TO the job rather
    than the other way round. Where work is ROUTED is a different decision from
    where a conversation GROUPS, and ADR-0024 was the latter.
